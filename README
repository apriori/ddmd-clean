ddmd-clean README, by Zach the Mystic
see NOTES for some random notes as to how I changed ddmd to get to this point

Hi, thanks for reading me.

  The main problem with the ddmd project ( http://www.dsource.org/projects/ddmd )
is that Digital Mars D (dmd), written in C++, is just chock-full of code which
you simply wouldn't write if you were programming it in D.  Therefore you
have things like "alias Vector!Dsymbol Dsymbols;" followed later by "Dsymbols
members;", followed by "members = new Dsymbols;", when in D you would just write
"Dsymbol[] members;" and be on your way.

  ddmd-clean is the seed of a true D language port of the dmd compiler. The
whole class heirarchy is maintained and all the crappy C++ weirdness is gone.
Unfortunately, in order to make it clean, certain "conveniences" had to be
sacrificed. Ummm... I entirely erased all of the semantic analysis and the
backend. Also, even the Lexer and Parser, as they stand, are not written using
cutting edge D/phobos techonology. The Lexer still uses good old-fashioned
C-style pointers, when I'm sure it could be made more elegant and robust (though
probably not any faster!) using phobos Ranges ( update this FILE if you
choose to fix it! ). And the main.d program, a.k.a. mars.c, has been utterly
destroyed by my youth and inexperience! Nonetheless it seemed like it would have
been better had it been written in D/phobos anyway. Since all I needed were the
Lexer and Parser I wasn't too worried about what I might do to main.d.

  Anyway, I chose to put this stripped-down version of the ddmd lexer and parser
on github now since I had lofty ideas about my own program which would require my
changing the basic structure of the Lexer and Parser themselves. (Feb. 2, 2012).
I hope there's something here that you can use.

  Peace,
  Zach
