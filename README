see NOTES for updates and for some notes as to how ddmd has been changed

Hi, thanks for reading me.

ddmd-clean is Digital Mars D ported to the D Programming Language. Instead of
porting everything, which wouuld be overwhelming, ddmd-clean has only ported
dmd's Lexer, Parser, and Code Generation capabilities. I started with ddmd (
http://www.dsource.org/projects/ddmd ), and then cut out all the semantic and
backend. But the real work was in converting all the weird C++ style code to
much awesomer D equivalents.

To witness the power of what's already here, first take a look at main.d. Then,
simply type:

ddmd-clean$ ./build.sh

or its equivalent:

ddmd-clean$ rdmd -J./dmd main
